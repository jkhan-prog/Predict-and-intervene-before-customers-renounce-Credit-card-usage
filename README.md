Credit cards are a good source of income for banks because of different kinds of fees charged by the banks 
like annual fees, balance transfer fees, and cash advance fees, late payment fees, foreign transaction fees, 
and others. Some fees are charged on every user irrespective of usage, while others are charged under specified circumstances.

Customers’ leaving credit cards services would lead bank to loss, so the bank wants to analyze the data of customers’ 
and identify the customers who will leave their credit card services and reason for same – so that bank could improve upon those areas
