To predict and intervene Credit Card customers before they renounce Credit card usage


Bank noticed a steep decline in the number of users of their credit card. 
Credit cards are a good source of income for banks because of different kinds of fees charged by the banks 
like annual fees, balance transfer fees, and cash advance fees, late payment fees, foreign transaction fees, 
and others. Some fees are charged on every user irrespective of usage, while others are charged under specified circumstances.

Customers’ leaving credit cards services would lead bank to loss, so the bank wants to analyze the data of customers’ 
and identify the customers who will leave their credit card services and reason for same – so that bank could improve upon those areas

Developed a model to predict churn rate of customers to intervene to keep them loyal; using Python with pipeline of Supervised ML models 
such as Logistic, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient, AdaBoost and XGBoost classifiers.

 Best model was selected based on a comprehensive comparative analysis that included feature importance, nested-cross validation 
and hyper-tuning of parameters

 Demonstrated Pipeline of ML models with high training and test scores and business recommendations.
